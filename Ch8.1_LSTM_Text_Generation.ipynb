    "# Ch.8 Generative Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential of artificial intelligence to emulate human thought processes goes beyond passive tasks such as object recognition and mostly reactive tasks such as driving a car. It extends well into creative activities. In the summer of 2015, we were entertained by Google’s DeepDream algorithm turning an image into a psychedelic mess of dog eyes and pareidolic artifacts; in 2016, we used the Prisma application to turn photos into paintings of various styles. In the summer of 2016, an experimental short movie, Sunspring, was directed using a script written by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm—complete with dialogue. Maybe you’ve recently listened to music that was tentatively generated by a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granted, the artistic productions we’ve seen from AI so far have been fairly low quality. AI isn’t anywhere close to rivaling human screenwriters, painters, and composers. But replacing humans was always beside the point: artificial intelligence isn’t about replacing our own intelligence with something else, it’s about bringing into our lives and work more intelligence—intelligence of a different kind. In many fields, but especially in creative ones, AI will be used by humans as a tool to augment their own capabilities: more augmented intelligence than artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of artistic creation consists of simple pattern recognition and technical skill. And that’s precisely the part of the process that many find less attractive or even dispensable. That’s where AI comes in. Our perceptual modalities, our language, and our artwork all have statistical structure. Learning this structure is what deep-learning algorithms excel at. Machine-learning models can learn the statistical latent space of images, music, and stories, and they can then sample from this space, creating new artworks with characteristics similar to those the model has seen in its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1 Text generation with LSTM\n",
    "In this section, we’ll explore how recurrent neural networks can be used to generate sequence data. We’ll use text generation as an example, but the exact same techniques can be generalized to any kind of sequence data: you could apply it to sequences of musical notes in order to generate new music, to timeseries of brushstroke data (for example, recorded while an artist paints on an iPad) to generate paintings stroke by stroke, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence data generation is in no way limited to artistic content generation. It has been successfully applied to speech synthesis and to dialogue generation for chatbots. The Smart Reply feature that Google released in 2016, capable of automatically generating a selection of quick replies to emails or text messages, is powered by similar techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1.1 A brief history of generative recurrent networks\n",
    "In late 2014, few people had ever seen the initials LSTM, even in the machine-learning community. Successful applications of sequence data generation with recurrent networks only began to appear in the mainstream in 2016.\n",
    "Since then, recurrent neural networks have been successfully used for music generation, dialogue generation, image generation, speech synthesis, and molecule design. They were even used to produce a movie script that was then cast with live actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1.2 How do you generate sequences?\n",
    "The universal way to generate sequence data in deep learning is to train a network (usually an RNN or a convnet) to predict the next token or next few tokens in a sequence, using the previous tokens as input. For instance, given the input “the cat is on the ma,” the network is trained to predict the target t, the next character. As usual when working with text data, tokens are typically words or characters, and any network that can model the probability of the next token given the previous ones is called a language model. A language model captures the latent space of language: its statistical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have such a trained language model, you can sample from it (generate new sequences): you feed it an initial string of text (called conditioning data), ask it to generate the next character or the next word (you can even generate several tokens at once), add the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process many times (see image below). This loop allows you to generate sequences of arbitrary length that reflect the structure of the data on which the model was trained: sequences that look almost like human-written sentences. In the example we present in this section, you’ll take a LSTM layer, feed it strings of N characters extracted from a text corpus, and train it to predict character N + 1. The output of the model will be a softmax over all possible characters: a probability distribution for the next character. This LSTM is called a character-level neural language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text gen](images/8_1_2_textgen.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1.3 The importance of the sampling strategy\n",
    "When generating text, the way you choose the next character is crucially important. A naive approach is greedy sampling, consisting of always choosing the most likely next character. But such an approach results in repetitive, predictable strings that don’t look like coherent language. A more interesting approach makes slightly more surprising choices: it introduces randomness in the sampling process, by sampling from the probability distribution for the next character. This is called stochastic sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling probabilistically from the softmax output of the model is neat: it allows even unlikely characters to be sampled some of the time, generating more interesting-looking sentences and sometimes showing creativity by coming up with new, realistic-sounding words that didn’t occur in the training data. But there’s one issue with this strategy: it doesn’t offer a way to control the amount of randomness in the sampling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want more or less randomness? Consider an extreme case: pure random sampling, where you draw the next character from a uniform probability distribution, and every character is equally likely. This scheme has maximum randomness; in other words, this probability distribution has maximum entropy. Naturally, it won’t produce anything interesting. At the other extreme, greedy sampling doesn’t produce anything interesting, either, and has no randomness: the corresponding probability distribution has minimum entropy. **Sampling from the “real” probability distribution—the distribution that is output by the model’s softmax function—constitutes an intermediate point between these two extremes.** But there are many other intermediate points of higher or lower entropy that you may want to explore. Less entropy will give the generated sequences a more predictable structure, whereas more entropy will result in more surprising and creative sequences. When sampling from generative models, it’s always good to explore different amounts of randomness in the generation process. Because we—humans—are the ultimate judges of how interesting the generated data is, interestingness is highly subjective, and there’s no telling in advance where the point of optimal entropy lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control the amount of stochasticity in the sampling process, we’ll introduce a parameter called the softmax temperature that characterizes the entropy of the probability distribution used for sampling: it characterizes how surprising or predictable the choice of the next character will be. Let's see the code:"
